# Machine-learning-behind-the-curtain
This dataset was used to learn more about how some machine learning models work: KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. It also includes some model evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-Score. These metrics were derived from the confusion matrix.
